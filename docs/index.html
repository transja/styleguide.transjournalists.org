<p>The Trans Journalists Association’s Stylebook and Coverage Guide is a tool reporters, editors, and other journalists can use to improve breaking news and enterprise coverage of trans communities and issues affecting them. While this guide provides a strong foundation for covering transgender, nonbinary, and gender-expansive people with sensitivity and care, trans communities are incredibly diverse. The language some trans people use to describe themselves and their communities might differ from or contradict parts of this guide. Reporting with nuance on trans issues requires thought and care, and this guide is only a starting point.</p>
